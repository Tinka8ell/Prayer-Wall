# Prayer-Wall
Interactive Prayer Wall - implemented as physical video-wall and online a web pages.

Originally concieved as an interactive video wall where prayers could be posted, read, prayed for and responded to.
It grew into both a physical presence and an online accessible view to support a 24-7 prayer room during COVID restrictions and lockdowns.
Those using it in the prayer room could interact with those access the prayer space from on-line.
Later added a booking system to support dual (multiple) location prayer slots.

Backed by a Maridb (MySQL database) running on a Raspberry Pi Apache Web Server using DJango.

Physical prayer wall is 6 Raspberry Pi 4's controlling 2 monitors each.
